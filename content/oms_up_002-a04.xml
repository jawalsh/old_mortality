                <head rendition="#uppercase">Christmas at Oxford.</head>
                <p>We verily believe that to the mind of many an innocent Undergraduate the worst
                    possible punishment that an angry Proctor could inflict on any offender against
                    University discipline, would be compulsory residence in Oxford during
                    Christmas-tide. In the eyes of many, the man who from accident, choice, or
                    necessity spends his Christmas at Oxford, is looked upon as such an ill fated
                    wight that only a few years back the Christmas number of the <title>"Illustrated
                        London News"</title> contained a most melancholy and pathetic story,
                    entitled "The only man left in College on Christmas day." On perusal it makes
                    the reader almost as melancholy and unhappy as the unfortunate subject of the
                    narrative; but if any of our readers imagine an Oxford Christmas to be anything
                    half so miserable as the story would have them to believe, we beg to assure them
                    that they are very much mistaken. We think that there are few places in England
                    where Christmas is attended with so much festivity as in Oxford, and where
                    absence from home at that festive season is to be less regretted. And to prove
                    this assertion we need only bring before the notice of our readers two of the
                    festivities peculiar to the place, and endeavour to describe how Christmas is
                    ushered in at Magdalen College, and how it is observed at Queen's.</p>
                <p>It is Christmas eve, and a few minutes before 9 o'clock. The Hall of Magdalen
                    presents a gay and animated appearance: decked with evergreens, brilliant with
                    light, and radiant with a multitude of happy faces; it wears its brightest look,
                    The gallery—occupied by ladies—whose fair faces and gay dresses add much to the
                    beauty of the scene: the high table groaning beneath a sumptuous supper, and a
                    large collection of College plate. In the centre the Christmas tree writh its
                    many tapers, banners and devices, all rivet the eye and form a coup d'csil not
                    often witnessed.</p>
                <p>Nine o'clock strikes—<title>The Overture to the Messiah</title> is commenced,
                    after which the rest of the first part of the Oratorio, one airexceptcd, is
                    performed by a choir of forty or fifty voices, under the direction of the
                    Organist.</p>
                <p>Ten o'clock strikes—Soon after supper is served, and the Choristers, for whose
                    especial benefit the entertainment was originally set on foot, take their places
                    at the high table, while Rev. Doctors of Divinity, and the senior Members of the
                    College, become, for the time, their attendants,</p>
                <p>Eleven o'clock strikes—Christmas Carols now commence, and the Choir being divided
                    into two parts, are wafted from one side to the other. They are led off by the
                    6ld favourite— <quote rendition="#blockquote"><l>"Christmas comes the time of
                            gladness,</l>
                        <l rendition="#l-indent-1">Which our fathers gave to mirth,</l>
                        <l>Then no time had they for sadness,</l>
                        <l rendition="#l-indent-1">Joyous at the Saviour's birth."</l></quote></p>
                <p>When these are finished a pause takes place, and silence is preserved until the
                    clock has tolled the solemn hour of midnight, immediately upon which the song of
                    the Angels bursts forth— <title>"Gloria in excelus Deo"</title>—and amid the
                    concluding murmurs of "Pax," "Pax," the bells ring out a merry peal, spreading
                    the joyful news far and wide that the gladsome festival of Christmas had begun.
                    The grace-cup then goes round, and amid wishes of a "Merry Christmas and a happy
                    New Year" the party breaks up.</p>
                <p>We will chronicle one other festivity. It is Christmas-day, and dinner-time at
                    Queen's, the Provost and Fellows have taken their places at the high table, and
                    the Hall is crammed with a mass of expectant visitors. The usual summons to
                    dinner is given by sound of the trumpet, upon which two Cooks appear in white
                    apron's and caps, bearing aloft a huge "Boar's Head," its Tusks gilded, in its
                    mouth a lemon, and the dish decked with flowers and banners, this they bear
                    slowly up the Hall, while, by a choir of voices, is sung the old hymn— <quote
                        rendition="#blockquote"><l>The Boar's bead in band Ozar I,</l>
                        <l>Bedecked with bays and rosemary,</l>
                        <l>And I pray you my masters be merry,</l>
                        <l>Quot estes in convivio,</l>
                        <l rendition="#l-indent-1">Caput apri defero, reddens laudes
                    domina!</l></quote></p>
                <p>This being concluded, the crowd take a last look at the head now deposited in the
                    centre of the high table, and slowly depart. Long may such ancient and
                    interesting customs be found among us, and long may Oxford be celebrated for the
