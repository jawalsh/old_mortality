  Canto I
  </head>
  <note rendition="#i">Of the birth of Sir Tristram, and how he voyaged into Ireland.</note>
  <lg>
    <l>In the noble days were shown</l>
    <l>Deeds of good knights many one,</l>
    <l>Many worthy wars were done.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>It was time of scath and scorn</l>
    <l>When at breaking of the morn</l>
    <l>Tristram the good knight was born.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>He was fair and well to see</l>
    <l>As his mother's child might be:</l>
    <l>Many happy wars had he;</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Slew Moronde the knight alone,</l>
    <l>Whence was all the ill begun</l>
    <l>That on Blancheflour was done.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>For long since Queen Blancheflour</l>
    <l>Took a knight to paramour,</l>
    <l>Who had served her well of yore.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And across the waters dim</l>
    <l>And by many a river's rim</l>
    <l>Went Queen Blancheflour with him.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Many a bitter path she went,</l>
    <l>Many a stone her feet had rent,</l>
    <l>But her heart was well content.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>'Lo,' she said,'I lady free</l>
    <l>Took this man for lord of me</l>
    <l>Where the crowned saints might see.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And I will not bid him go,</l>
    <l>Not for joyance nor for woe,</l>
    <l>Till my very love he know.'</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>When he kissed her as they went,</l>
    <l>All her heart was well content,</l>
    <l>For the love that she him meant.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  No. 1.
  </fw>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l>Now this knight was called Roland,</l>
    <l>And he bad within his hand</l>
    <l>Ermonie the happy land.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>So five months in Ermonie</l>
    <l>Dwelt they in their pleasure free ;</l>
    <l>For they knew not what should be.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then came Moronde with his men,</l>
    <l>Warring with her lord again.</l>
    <l>All her heart was bitter then.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>But she said; if this be so,</l>
    <l>Tho’ I die, he shall not know.</l>
    <l>And she kissed and bade him go ;</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And he wept and went from her.</l>
    <l>Then was all the land astir</l>
    <l>With a trouble in the air.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>When Roland the knight was gone,</l>
    <l>Praise of men his warriors won</l>
    <l>Warring well before the sun.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>But Moronde the evil knight</l>
    <l>Smote him falsely in the fight.</l>
    <l>Slew him barely out of sight.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then was weeping long and sore:</l>
    <l>For the great love they him bore</l>
    <l>All men wept but Blancheflour.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>But she took her golden ring</l>
    <l>And a fair sword of the king</l>
    <l>Wrought with many a carven thing.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>With no crown about her head,</l>
    <l>Thinking wild thoughts of the dead,</l>
    <l>Evermore she fled and fled.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Far within the forest fair,</l>
    <l>A great anguish came on her</l>
    <l>Till a strong manchild she bare.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And she fain had suckled him,</l>
    <l>There beneath the lindens dim,</l>
    <l>Round a fountain's weedy brim.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l>But too soon came death to take</l>
    <l>All her beauty for his sake ;</l>
    <l>And ere death she moaned and spake</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>'Ah fair child,' the lady said,</l>
    <l>For this anguish’ that it had</l>
    <l>All thy mother’s heart is dead.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Sweet, I would not live to see</l>
    <l>Any sorrow rest on thee,</l>
    <l> Better thou hadst died with me.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Only thou art still too fair</l>
    <l> For that smile I cannot bear</l>
    <l>In such eyes as Roland’s were.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Now, fair child, mine own wertthou,</l>
    <l>(And she kissed the small soft brow)</l>
    <l> But for death that takes me now.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And a bitter birth is thine ;</l>
    <l> But no man can stain thy line</l>
    <l> With a shame that was not mine.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Thou art pure and princely born;</l>
    <l> Fairer name was never worn.</l>
    <l> Past the touch of any-scorn.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Now thy grief has come on me,</l>
    <l> As I prayed that it might be</l>
    <l> Lest some woe should rest on thee.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Wept the low voice musical;</l>
    <l> 4 Now that mine has given thee all,</l>
    <l> Better love thy love befall.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Purer prayers be round thy sleep.</l>
    <l> Truer tears than these that drip</l>
    <l> On thy tender cheek and lip.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Now, dear child, of all on earth</l>
    <l> Thou art yet the fairest birth</l>
    <l> For the pain thy life was worth.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> Sweetest name and sweetest heart,</l>
    <l> Now I see thee as thou art</l>
    <l> 1 have had the better part.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l>For the grief my love has had,</l>
    <l> May the sweet saints keep thee glad</l>
    <l>Tho’ thy birth were strange and sad.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Now, dear child, (her thin voice strove</l>
    <l>Thro’ the drawn dry sobs to move)</l>
    <l>1 Leave I thee to Christ’s own love/</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>So she died in that dark place, </l>
    <l>With the anguish in her face;</l>
    <l>Mary took her into grace.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>On the robe was sown her name,</l>
    <l>Where a fine thread white as flame</l>
    <l>Thro’ the coloured samite came.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>For on skirt and hem between</l>
    <l>Wrought she letters white and green</l>
    <l>'This is Blancheflour the queen'</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>There men found her as they sped,</l>
    <l>Very beautiful and dead,</l>
    <l>In the lilies white and red.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And beside her lying there,</l>
    <l>Found a manchild strong and fair</l>
    <l>Lain among the lilies bare.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And they thought it were ill fate,</l>
    <l>If the child, for fear or hate,</l>
    <l>They should leave in evil state.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>So they took him lying there,</l>
    <l>Playing with the lady’s hair,</l>
    <l>For his face was very fair.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And so tenderly he played,</l>
    <l>Half asmile and half afraid,</l>
    <l>With her lips and hair, I said,</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>That the strong men for his sake</l>
    <l>Could have wept for dear heartache</l>
    <l>At the murmurs he did make.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And the strongest lightly stept</l>
    <l> Forth to where the mother slept;</l>
    <l> Stooping over her, he wept.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l>Lightly bowed above the child</l>
    <l>The large face whose might was mild</l>
    <l>With black-bearded lips that smiled.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then he took it of his grace,</l>
    <l>Bowed him where she lay in place,</l>
    <l>Put to her’s the little face.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then they softly buried her</l>
    <l>Where the greenest leaves did stir,</l>
    <l>With some white flowers in her hair.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And for the sweet look he had,</l>
    <l>Weeping not but very sad,</l>
    <l> Tristram by his name they bade.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>'For he looks upon her so,</l>
    <l>Pity were he should not grow</l>
    <l>All the piteous thing to know/</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And they took the sword and ring</l>
    <l>That were of Roland the king,</l>
    <l>W rought with many a carven thing,</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>So they bred him as they knew;</l>
    <l>And a noble child he grew,</l>
    <l>Like a tree in sun and dew.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Ere he was ten summers old</l>
    <l> All the sorrow they him told,</l>
    <l>Shewed the sword and ring of gold.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
  <l>Kissed the boy both sword and ring;</l>
  <l>‘ As my father was a king,</l>
  <l>I will wreak this bitter thing/</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Kissed the boy both ring and sword ;</l>
    <l>‘As my mother to her lord,</l>
    <l>Fast I cling to this my word/</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>So he grew in might and grace,</l>
    <l>With her look about his face:</l>
    <l>All men saw his royal race.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>But when twenty years were done</l>
    <l>At the rising of the sun</l>
    <l>Tristram from his place was gone.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l>Forth with warriors is he bound</l>
    <l>Over many a change of ground,</l>
    <l>To have wreak of Sir Moronde.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>When they came to Ermonie,</l>
    <l>Bare upon the earth bowed he,</l>
    <l>Kissed the earth with kisses three.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>To the city men him bring,</l>
    <l>Where the herald stood to sing</l>
    <l>‘Largesse of Moronde the king!’</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>To the king came Tristram then,</l>
    <l>To Moronde the evil man,</l>
    <l>Treading softly as he can.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Spake he loftily in place:</l>
    <l>A great light was on his face:</l>
    <l>Listen, king, of thy free grace.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
  <l>I am Tristram, Roland’s son;</l>
  <l>By thy might my lands were won,</l>
  <l>All my lovers were undone.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Died by thee queen Blancheflour,</l>
    <l>Mother mine in bitter hour’</l>
    <l>That was white as any flower.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Tho’ they died not well aright,</l>
    <l>Yet, for thou art belted knight,</l>
    <l> King Moronde, I bid thee fight/</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>A great laughter laughed they all,</l>
    <l>Drinking wine about the hall,</l>
    <l>Standing by the outer wall.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>But the pale king leapt apace,</l>
    <l>Caught his staff that lay in place</l>
    <l>And smote Tristram on the face.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Tristram stood back paces two,</l>
    <l>All his face was reddened so</l>
    <l>Round the deep mark of the blow.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Large and bright his king’s eyes grew</l>
    <l>As knight Roland’s sword he drew,</l>
    <l>Fiercely like a pard he flew.</l>
  </lg>
  <fw>
  Queen Yseult.
  </fw>
  <lg>
    <l> And above the staring eyes</l>
    <l>Smote Moronde the king flatwise,</l>
    <l>That meu saw the dear blood rise.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>At the second time he smote,</l>
    <l>All the carven blade, I wot’</l>
    <l>With the blood was blurred and hot.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>At the third stroke that he gave,</l>
    <l>Deep the carven steel he drave,</l>
    <l>Thro’ king Moronde’s heart it clave.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Well I ween his wound was great</l>
    <l>As he sank across the seat,</l>
    <l>Slain for Blancheflour the sweet.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then spake Tristram, praising God;</l>
    <l>In his father’s place he stood</l>
    <l> Wiping clean the smears of blood,</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>That the sword, while he did pray,</l>
    <l>At the throne’s foot he might lay;</l>
    <l>Christ save all good knights, I say.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Then spake all men in his praise,</l>
    <l>Speaking' words of the old days,</l>
    <l>Sweeter words than sweetest lays.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Said one‘lo the dead queen’s hair</l>
    <l>And her brows so straight and fair;</l>
    <l>So the lips of Roland were.’</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>For all praised him as he stood,</l>
    <l>That such things none other could</l>
    <l>Than the son of kingly blood.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Round be looked with quiet eyes;</l>
    <l>‘ When ye saw king Moronde rise,</l>
    <l>None beheld me on this wise.</l>
  </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>At such words as he did say,</l>
      <l>Bare an old man knelt to pray;</l>
      <l>'Christ be with us all to-day.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>This is Tristram the good lord;</l>
      <l>Knightly hath he held his word,</l>
      <l>Warring with his father’s sword.’</l>
    </lg>
    <fw>
    Queen Yseult.
    </fw>
    <lg>
      <l>Then one brought the diadem,</l>
      <l>Clear and golden like pure flame;</l>
      <l>And his thanks did grace to them.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l> Next in courteous wise he bade</l>
      <l>That fair honour should be had</l>
      <l>Of the dear queen that was dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>So in her great sorrow’s praise</l>
      <l> A fair tomb he bade them raise</l>
      <l>For a wonder to the days.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>And between its roof and floor</l>
      <l>Wrote he two words and no more,</l>
      <l>Wrote <title rend="i">Roland</title> and <title rendition="#i">Blancheflour</title>.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>That was carvep sharp in gold,</l>
      <l>For a great praise to behold,</l>
      <l>Where the queen lay straight and cold.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>All was graven deep and fine,</l>
      <l>In and out, and line with line,</l>
      <l>That all men might see it shine.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>So far off it sprang and shone,</l>
      <l>Ere ten paces one had gone,</l>
      <l>Shewing all the sorrow done.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>And the pillars, that upbore</l>
      <l>The large roof for evermore,</l>
      <l>In wrought flowers her sweet name wore</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Points of stone carved gently all,</l>
      <l>Wrought in cusp and capital,</l>
      <l>Climbing still to creep and fall.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>And in many a tender nook,</l>
      <l>Traced soft as running brook,</l>
      <l> Shone her face's quiet look.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>And above they wrought to lie</l>
      <l>King Roland all white on high,</l>
      <l>With the lady carren by.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Very patient was her face,</l>
      <l>Stooping from its maiden place</l>
      <l>Into strange new mother-grace.</l>
    </lg>
    <fw>
    Queen Yseult.
    </fw>
    <lg>
      <l>Parted lips and closing eyes,</l>
      <l>All the quiet of the skies</l>
      <l>Fills her beauty where she lies.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>On her hair the forest crown</l>
      <l>Lets the sliding tresses down,</l>
      <l>Touched ere dark with golden brown</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Both with carven bands uplift,</l>
      <l>Praying sofily as at shrift.</l>
      <l> So it stood a kingly gift.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>And when all was graven fair</l>
      <l>Tristram came, and standing there</l>
      <l> Kissed his mother's tender hair.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Then he bade them take for King</l>
      <l>His true father in each thing,</l>
      <l>Him who saved the sword and ring.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>So they hearkened to his word,</l>
      <l>And they took to be their lord</l>
      <l>Him who kept the ring and sword.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Then by many painful ways,</l>
      <l>With a noble thought in chase,</l>
      <l> Tristram journeyed many days.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Towards the Cornwall king he bore,</l>
      <l> Since an oath of love he swore</l>
      <l>For the name of Blancheflour,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>That King Mark, her brother true,</l>
      <l>He would honour as he knew;</l>
      <l>This was he I tell to you.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>When he stood in Cornwall there,</l>
      <l>Mark beheld him standing bare,</l>
      <l> And he knew his sister’s hair.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Ail these things to Mark be told,</l>
      <l>To the king so lean and cold,</l>
      <l>And he shewed her ring of gold.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>Then wept ail the valiant men,</l>
      <l>Wept king Mark upon him then.</l>
      <l>Thinking what a grief had been.</l>
    </lg>
    <fw>
    Queen Yseult.
    </fw>
    <lg>
      <l>Then was Tristram belted knight,</l>
      <l>For his happy hand in fight.</l>
      <l>Then spake Mark in all men’s sight</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
      <l>‘ For the love my sister won,</l>
      <l>I will honour as I can</l>
      <l>This her son, the loved man.</l>
    </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And this praise I give him here:</l>
    <l>He shall go to bring anear</l>
    <l>My new bride with noble cheer.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>For strange things are said in place</l>
    <l>Of the wonder of her face</l>
    <l> And her tender woman's grace.’</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Spake the king so lean and cold.</l>
    <l>‘ She hath name of honour old,</l>
    <l> Yseult queen, the hair of gold.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l> All her limbs are fair and strong,</l>
    <l> And her face is straight and long,</l>
    <l>And her talk is as a song.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And faint lines of colour stripe</l>
    <l>(As spilt wine that one should wipe</l>
    <l>All her golden hair cornripe;</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Drawn like red gold ears that stand</l>
    <l>In the yellow summer land;</l>
    <l>Arrow-straight hor perfect hand,</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>And her eyes like river-lakes</l>
    <l>Where a gloomy glory shakes</l>
    <l>Which the happy sunset makes.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Her shall Tristram go to bring,</l>
    <l>With a gift of some rich thing</l>
    <l>Fit to free a prisoned king.’</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>As Sir Mark said, it was done;</l>
    <l>And ere set the morrow’s sun,</l>
    <l>Tristram the good knight was gone.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
    <l>Forth to Ireland bade he come,</l>
    <l>Forth across the grey sea-foam,</l>
    <l> All to bring Queen Yseult home.</l>
